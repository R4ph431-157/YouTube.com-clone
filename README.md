Took some time off the 100Devs curriculum to practice CSS and build my confidence before diving into JavaScript. 
SuperSimpleDevâ€™s course helped me a lot. Even though the CSS exercise that followed along the course seemed intimidating, I completed it and felt really proud of myself.
From the course and exercise, I was able to understand how positioning and the box model generally works, at least far better than I understood before.
